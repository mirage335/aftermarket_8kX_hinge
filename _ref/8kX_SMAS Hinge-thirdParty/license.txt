Original third-party files in this directory were obtained from the above sources.

Due to the use of 'Onshape', which is software-as-a-service, the link to the 'oshape.com' site *is* the original source code. Some files under the 'mod' directory - which may be in 'STEP' format, were exported, both to serve as backups copies of the most important geometry data, as well as parts for possible integration with further CAD assemblies.

File and directory names labeled with 'mod' in their names, listed above, or under the 'mod' subdirectory, are modified versions of the original files, and also retain the original license, as stated below, unless public domain or fair use.
